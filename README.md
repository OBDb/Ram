## About Ram

Ram is an American brand of light to mid-weight commercial vehicles established in 2010 as a spin-off from Dodge. The brand focuses primarily on pickup trucks and commercial vans.

## Generations

### Ram as Part of Dodge (1981-2009)
Initially, Ram trucks were part of the Dodge lineup, with the name "Ram" referring to the hood ornament used on Dodge vehicles. The Dodge Ram line was introduced in 1981, replacing the Dodge D Series. These trucks featured a more aggressive design and improved capabilities compared to their predecessors. In 1994, the second-generation Dodge Ram was released with its distinctive "big rig" styling that revolutionized truck design and significantly boosted sales.

### Ram as a Standalone Brand (2010-Present)
In 2010, Chrysler Group LLC (now part of Stellantis) separated Ram from Dodge, establishing it as a standalone brand focused exclusively on trucks and commercial vehicles. This strategic move allowed Ram to develop a distinct identity and concentrate on the specific needs of truck customers while Dodge could focus on performance passenger cars. Under its own brand, Ram has continued to innovate with features like the RamBox storage system, air suspension, and luxury interior options that have helped position it as a strong competitor in the truck market.
